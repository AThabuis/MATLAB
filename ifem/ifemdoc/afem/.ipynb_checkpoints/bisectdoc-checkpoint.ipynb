    "Newest vertex bisection is to assign the refinement edge as the\n",
    "edge opposite to the newest vertex added in the bisection. To begin with,\n",
    "for an initial triangulation $\\mathcal T_0$, we can label the longest edge of each triangle as the refinement edge. Once a initial labeling is assigned to $\\mathcal T_0$, \n",

    "of a triangle: `elem(t,[1 2 3])` are global indices of three vertices of\n",
    "the triangle `t`. The only requirement on the ordering is that the\n",
